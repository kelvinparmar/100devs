# How Internet works?

- When 1989 we have to share information at that time no option to share documents immediately so sir Tim Berners-Lee was invented WWW which is known World Wide Web. It is a medium to share any information via the hyperlink.
- But it works when internet available so that time internet was come. After that people are use that WWW but it again created problems because WWW only works on hyperlink so no one can chat , make a call , or any real time work.So problem was not resolved.
-  To resolve this problem Web Development was come and it works on client-server model.
-  In that when Client request for query then send it to the server and server check it and give back to the client.You can see that this is so simple process but that's not easy.

## Here is the picture of how internet works :

- Here client open the browser and search for the something like https://youtube.com , then client's browser send that request to the nearest ISP (Internet Service Provider) that provides us internet.
- Now that ISP forward that request to DNS which converts into IP and that IP forward to the server IP address now server will try to find the response for the client request if it's available then give it back to client's browser with same path.
- So here client send request which means its all control by the client so that client side is known as Front-end in Web Development and server is known as Back-end Development.
